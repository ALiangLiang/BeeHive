BeeHive
================
BeeHive is an experiment for visualizing user location data provided by the mobile instant messaging app BeeTalk.

BeeHive reads data asynchronously, and place a marker on specific location on the map for each single row of data, which basically consists of name, gender, birthday, ID, status, and last updated time.

## Usage
To set up the database, you may refer to **db.schema.sql** for schema, which is similar with the schema of the database used by the mobile app itself.

## Future Plan
 - Show realtime data
 - Filtering options
